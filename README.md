# Geo-Environmental-Respiratory-Disease-Prediction
## Predicting chronic respiratory diseases using socio-environmental factors and geographic data.
In this project, which was my capstone project for the Big Data specialization, we aimed to investigate and predict the prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases, specifically asthma and COPD, based on socio-environmental and geographic factors. We collected data from various sources, including the National Health Service (NHS) in England, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and others. The data encompassed disease prevalence, quality of care indicators, income levels, deprivation indices, demographic information, and geographic variables such as proximity to public parks and private gardens.

Through extensive data processing, we cleaned, transformed, and integrated these diverse datasets. We employed techniques like data merging, geographic area conversions, and value weighting to create a comprehensive panel dataset. This panel served as the foundation for our analysis, enabling us to explore the intricate relationships between the socio-environmental factors and the target variables of asthma and COPD prevalence rates at the general practice (GP) level. This project was my capstone work for the Data Science/Big Data specialization.
